# Azure Stack HCI Single Server Deployment

At Microsoft Build 2022, the Azure Stack HCI Single Node was announced on 5/24/2022. 

Unfortunately the Stack cannot be installed via the Windows Admin Center, so the installation has to be done via Powershell.

In this repository I provide the corresponding Powershell scripts for the deployment.


## Step 1 - Download Azure Stack HCI ISO Image

## Step 2 - Install ISO on your Hardware

## Step 3 - Configure the server

## Step 4 - Create cluster

## Step 5 - Register the cluster

## Step 6 - Create volumes

**Ready - your are done!**
