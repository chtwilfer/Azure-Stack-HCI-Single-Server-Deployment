# Azure Stack HCI Single Server Deployment

At Microsoft Build 2022, the Azure Stack HCI Single Node was announced on 5/24/2022. 

Since the stack unfortunately cannot be installed via the Windows Admin Center, the installation is done via Powershell.

In this repository I provide the corresponding Powershell scripts for the deployment.
