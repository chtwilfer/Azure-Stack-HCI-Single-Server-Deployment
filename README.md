# Azure Stack HCI Single Server Deployment

At Microsoft Build 2022, the Azure Stack HCI Single Node was announced on 5/24/2022. 

Unfortunately the Stack cannot be installed via the Windows Admin Center, so the installation has to be done via Powershell.

In this repository I provide the corresponding Powershell scripts for the deployment.


## Step 1 - Download Azure Stack HCI ISO Image

## Step 2 - Install ISO on your Hardware

## Step 3 - Connect to the Server

## Step 4 - Domain join

## Step 5 - Installation of roles and features

## Step 6- Cluster setup

## Step 7 - Prepare drives

## Step 8 - test cluster config

## Step 9 - Create cluster

## Step 10 - Configure host networking

## Step 11 - Enable Storage Spaces Direct

**Ready - your are done!**
